# 🔧 Configuration 

**ATHENA** relies on environment variables. Below is a guide on how to configure the service.


## 🌍 Environment Variables 

For settings, **ATHENA** loads configuration from a `.env` file or system environment variables. The following default `.env.example` file is provided for local development. 

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash title=".env"
# ========================
# 🔭 Dash Configuration
# ========================
DASH_HOST=0.0.0.0
DASH_PORT=8050  
DASH_DEBUG=True

```

To use this configuration, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and modify the values as needed.

Now that environment variables and secrets are set, continue with **instructions**. 🎯
