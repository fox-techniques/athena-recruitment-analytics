# ‚ö°Ô∏è Prerequisites

To run **ATHENA** Recuitment Analytics dashboard, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10+
- Poetry or pip
- Git
- Docker 

---

## üêç Python 3.10+

Ensure you have **Python 3.10+** installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Check your version:

```bash
python --version

```
For installation guides and troubleshooting, refer to the [RealPython](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) documentation.

## üì¶ Package managers


=== "Poetry"

    !!! tip "Why We Recommend Poetry Over pip"

        While pip is the standard Python package manager, **we strongly recommend using Poetry for managing dependencies**.

        - **Simplified Dependency Management** ‚Äì Poetry resolves, installs, and locks dependencies automatically, preventing version conflicts.
        - **Built-in Virtual Environments** ‚Äì Unlike pip, Poetry creates and manages isolated environments for your projects.
        - **Reproducible Installs** ‚Äì Poetry uses pyproject.toml and poetry.lock to ensure consistency across different environments.
        - **Better Publishing Workflow** ‚Äì If you plan to contribute or package extensions, Poetry makes publishing to PyPI seamless.

        For long-term projects and production environments, Poetry provides a **more robust and scalable solution** than pip.

    Install Poetry as package manager and dependencies management:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

    Check if Poetry is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    poetry --version
    
    ```

=== "pip"

    !!! info "Knowledge"

        If you don't have prior experience with Python, we recommend reading
        [Using Python's pip to Manage Your Projects' Dependencies], which is a
        really good introduction on the mechanics of Python package management and
        helps you troubleshoot if you run into errors.

    Upgrade pip to the latest version: 

    ``` sh
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

## üå± Git

Ensure you have **Git** installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Check your version:

```bash
git --version
```
